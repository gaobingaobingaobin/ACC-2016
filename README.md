Code to generate figures from the paper "Semidefinite relaxations in optimal experiment design with application to substrate injection for hyperpolarized MRI" by John Maidens and Murat Arcak

To generate figures, please ensure that the following MATLAB toolboxes are installed and included on your path: 
* Symbolic Math Toolbox
* CVX Toolbox for Disciplined Convex Programming (available at http://cvxr.com/cvx/). 

The figures can be generated by running the file MAIN.m. 

This code has been tested using MATLAB version R2014b (8.4) for 64-bit mac with Symbolic Math Toolbox Version 6.1 and CVX Version 1.22.
